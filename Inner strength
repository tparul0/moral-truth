God used broken things very beautifully.Cloud break on rain.The soil breaks into the field.Seed sprouts when fruit breaks.A new breed germinates on the breakdown of the seed,so when you feel broken yourself ,it means God wants you to use a great utility.
So no need to be depressed.If we are in trouble then God is taking our exam  to build us very strong.To facing the problems ,we have to build a strongest inner strength.We have to make a big change in ourselves.
Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths.When you will go with your hardship and not decide to surrender.
You have power over your mind ,Realise this and will find strength.
